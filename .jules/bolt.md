## 2024-04-01 - History file inline rotation bottleneck
**Learning:** `history.Logger.rotateLockedInline()` runs every 100 appends. Previously, it called `readAll()` to get the current number of entries, which meant doing O(N) unmarshaling of every JSON line in the file, resulting in 300ms+ spikes when the file grew to ~90k lines, stalling heavy load.
**Action:** Always count lines efficiently (e.g. `bytes.Count(buf, []byte{'\n'})`) to verify constraints before performing expensive parse-heavy operations in recurring/background tasks.
